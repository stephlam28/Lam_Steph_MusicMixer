no sample audio files as of yet, want something similar to 108/ocean with just snares and claps to keep simplicity

site would have 108 circle on left side but drag and drop function on right referencing ocean rather than keybinds (maybe viceversa for easier use);
it'd be dragging and dropping beats into circle that turn into simple shapes like 108.
